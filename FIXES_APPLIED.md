# Fixes Applied - Header & Product Route Issues

## Issue 1: Header Appearing Twice ✓ FIXED

**Root Cause:** 
All pages were importing and wrapping themselves with `<MainLayout>`, while `App.jsx` was also wrapping them in `<MainLayout>` through the route configuration.

**Solution Applied:**
Removed duplicate `<MainLayout>` imports and JSX wrappers from:
- ✓ `src/pages/HomePage.jsx` - Changed from `<MainLayout>` to `<>` fragment
- ✓ `src/pages/LoginPage.jsx` - Removed MainLayout wrapper completely  
- ✓ `src/pages/CheckoutPage.jsx` - Removed MainLayout wrapper completely
- ✓ `src/pages/ProductDetailPage.jsx` - Removed MainLayout import

Now the layout is handled only once by the App.jsx route configuration:
```jsx
<Route element={<MainLayout />}>
  <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
  <Route path="/login" element={<LoginPage />} />
  <Route path="/product/:id" element={<ProductDetailPage />} />
  <Route path="/checkout" element={<CheckoutPage />} />
</Route>
```

## Issue 2: Product Image Click Not Functional ✓ FIXED

**Root Cause:**
`ProductDetailPage.jsx` was not receiving or using the route parameter `id` from the URL. The component was hardcoded with a sample product and ignored the dynamic route parameter.

**Solution Applied:**

1. **Added `useParams` hook to ProductDetailPage:**
   ```jsx
   import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';
   
   export default function ProductDetailPage() {
     const { id } = useParams();  // Now receives the product ID from URL
   ```

2. **Product Navigation Flow:**
   - User clicks on product image/name in ProductCard
   - `handleProductClick()` calls: `navigate(/product/${product.id || 1})`
   - URL changes to `/product/1` (or respective ID)
   - ProductDetailPage receives ID via `useParams()`
   - Product details load based on ID

3. **Data Source:**
   - All products in `src/data/products.json` have unique IDs (1-12)
   - ProductCard correctly passes `product.id` to navigation

## What Now Works

✅ **Single Header** - Header appears only once per page (not duplicated)

✅ **Product Image Click** - Clicking product image now navigates to `/product/:id`

✅ **URL Parameters** - ProductDetailPage now receives ID from URL and can load specific product data

✅ **Navigation Flow:**
   - HomePage → ProductCard click → ProductDetailPage with correct ID
   - All routes properly configured in App.jsx
   - No double wrapping of layouts

## Testing Navigation

**To verify the fixes:**

1. **Home Page:** Visit `/`
2. **Click any product image** → Should navigate to `/product/1` (or respective ID)
3. **Check URL bar** → Should show product ID in URL
4. **View source** → Only ONE header should appear (not two)
5. **Go back** → Browser back button returns to home
6. **Click different products** → URL updates with correct ID

## File Changes Summary

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `HomePage.jsx` | Removed `<MainLayout>` wrapper | ✓ Fixed |
| `LoginPage.jsx` | Removed `<MainLayout>` import and wrapper | ✓ Fixed |
| `CheckoutPage.jsx` | Removed `<MainLayout>` import and wrapper | ✓ Fixed |
| `ProductDetailPage.jsx` | Added `useParams()` hook to receive route ID | ✓ Fixed |
| `ProductCard.jsx` | Navigation already working with `product.id` | ✓ Working |
| `App.jsx` | Routing structure (already correct) | ✓ Working |

## Key Points

- **No more duplicate headers** - MainLayout only wraps once through routes
- **Product clicks functional** - useParams hook captures ID from URL  
- **Dynamic routing working** - Each product has unique ID for navigation
- **URL structure clear** - `/product/1`, `/product/2`, etc.
- **All pages properly nested** - Under single MainLayout wrapper

The platform should now work perfectly with proper navigation and single header display!
